# Injector Surrogate Environment for Badger
Repo: https://github.com/t-bz/lcls_cu_injector_nn_model/tree/main

Note: 
The PVs `QUAD:IN20:511:BACT` and `QUAD:IN20:525:BACT` are only 
available through the interface `lume`. This was done to simulate 
a situation where some desired EPICS PVs are not available through 
the environment and need to be added on the fly while running Badger.
